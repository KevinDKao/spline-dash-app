# Spline-Dash App

A modern web application that integrates Spline's powerful 3D design capabilities with Plotly Dash's interactive visualization framework to create beautiful, data-driven interfaces.

## Overview

This project combines the immersive 3D experiences created with Spline and the reactive capabilities of Dash to build compelling data visualization applications. It provides both a minimal starter template and an advanced implementation to help you get started.

## Features

- Seamless integration of Spline 3D scenes with Dash components
- Responsive layout design
- Interactive data visualization capabilities
- Two implementation examples:
  - Basic template (`app_blank.py`)
  - Advanced features showcase (`app_advanced.py`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip package manager

### Installation
